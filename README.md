Project Details: The service department at SENSIT Technologies needs to track the warranty life of various serialized sensors within an instrument. The database will store when the instrument was manufactured, product warranty life, customer name, instrument name, instrument serial number, sensors serial number, sensors warranty and the date installed. At the time of sale, a customer service representative will keep track of all instrument information and the sensors installed. Before the time of repair, the technician will determine the warranty status of the instrument and the sensors. If a sensor is in warranty and needs replaced, the technician will enter the part the serial number of each sensor replaced and the date it was replaced. Reports can be generated to query a instrument or customer name to see all the sensors and dates sensors were installed in order to determine the status of the warranty.
